First need to pull location data from different databases. 
For Compartments: http://compartments.jensenlab.org/Downloads use the knowledge channel, humans
For Protein Atlas: http://www.proteinatlas.org/about/download use the Subcellular Location Data
For LOCATE: http://locate.imb.uq.edu.au/downloads.shtml use the Homo sapiens Locate dataset.

When going through Compartments dataset, there were several terms that may have been referring to a secreted protein. Filtered through the terms and narrowed it down to a few to compile a list of possible secreted proteins.
Terms used for compartments: 'Vesicle', 'Secretory', 'Extracellular'. 'Golgi' and 'ER' were also used but after review of the terms that came from searching the two key words; 'ER to Golgi' was determined to be the best possible search term.
